Objective:The primary objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying food images into two categories: vegetarian and non-vegetarian and vegan dishes. The model aims to leverage extracted image features to distinguish between these two types of dishes.
#3. Machine Learning Pipeline for Vegetarian vs. Non-Vegetarian and Vegan Classification**

Embarking on the binary task of distinguishing between vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, I'll tailor a robust pipeline with diverse methodologies. Recognizing the challenge, especially when dishes may have nuanced characteristics, I aim to extend the model for improved classification.


1. Data Preparation:
   - Ensure standardized image formats.
   - Derive relevant features, building upon the successful components from the previous model.
   - Explore additional features if needed.

2. Classification Models:

a. Linear Classification:
   - Frame the task as linear classification, considering a multi-dimensional feature space.
   - Utilize a predictor vector (x=[1, x_1, x_2, ...]^T) and a coefficient vector (w=[w_0, w_1, w_2, ...]^T).
   - Evaluate model performance using a confusion matrix to identify misclassifications.

b. Logistic Regression:
   - Assess the efficacy of logistic regression for binary problem-solving in the new context.

c. kNN Algorithm:
   - Adapt the kNN algorithm, considering dataset size and potential overfitting.

Post-initial tests, exploration into fine-tuning and additional methods will be conducted to optimize and enhance the existing pipeline for accurate classification of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes.
